# Teaching Performant Code by Example

There are hundreds of C++ tutorials on the web, there are possibly a lot more introductions to parallelisms out there. However, none of the material I've seen contained a concise example from real life applications that exhibited a problem and how to fix it. This is where this material comes in to play.
